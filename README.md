## Descriptions
Program will generate an airline contract list from which you can pick up one. I did this to have some random flights generated for X-Plane. It calculates the distance between two airports and generates cargo and passenger loads. Airports list is contained either in files or database. Maybe adding some printing support in the future (like creating a loadsheet)

## Notes
Created this program to restart my Java programming. Basically what I wanted to achieve is following :
- use generics as I barely used it in the past
- use data reading/writing (either from file or database) and process this data
- use of CVS, namely Git
